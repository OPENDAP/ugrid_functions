Updated for version 1.0.1

This is the first official release of the ugrid_functions module. 
This module adds a server side function to Hyrax that allows a 
user to request domain subsets of unstructured gridded data sets 
that conform to the convention described here: 

    https://github.com/ugrid-conventions/ugrid-conventions

The subsetting function is called "ugr5". The syntax/usage statement
for the function is returned when the function is invoked without
parameters:

    http://server:8080/opendap/datsetname.ascii?ugr5()
    
This initial version is only compatibly with irregular traingular 
meshes. Both the Ugrid convention (see above link) and the gridfields 
library which implments the heavy lifting support other types of
unstructured grids so in the future support for these may be added.
